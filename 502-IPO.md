Suppose LeetCode will start its **IPO** soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the **IPO**. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most `k` distinct projects before the **IPO**. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most `k` distinct projects.

You are given `n` projects where the `ith` project has a pure profit `profits[i]` and a minimum capital of `capital[i]` is needed to start it.

Initially, you have `w` capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

Pick a list of **at most** `k` distinct projects from given projects to **maximize your final capital**, and return *the final maximized capital*.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: k = 3, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,2]
Output: 6

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= 105`
- `0 <= w <= 109`
- `n == profits.length`
- `n == capital.length`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `0 <= profits[i] <= 104`
- `0 <= capital[i] <= 109`

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaximizedCapital(int k, int w, int[] profits, int[] capital) {
        Queue<Integer> q = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());// 輸出獲利最高
        // 輸出
        int res = w;
        int len = profits.length;
        // [captital, profits]
        int[][] combines = new int[len][2];

        for(int i = 0; i< len; i++) {
            combines[i][0] = capital[i];
            combines[i][1] = profits[i];
        }
        Arrays.sort(combines, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);// 照cap由小到大排序
        
        int idx = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i< k; i++){
            while(idx < len && combines[idx][0] <= res) {
                q.offer(combines[idx][1]);
                idx++;
            }
            if(q.isEmpty()) break;
            // 取出當前可使用w中獲利最大的專案
            res += q.poll();
        }
        return res;
    }
}
