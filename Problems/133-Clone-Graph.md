Given a reference of a node in a [**connected**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph) undirected graph.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}

```

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

**Example 1:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133_clone_graph_question.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133_clone_graph_question.png)

```
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

```

**Example 2:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph.png)

```
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.

```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `Node.val` is unique for each node.
- There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
- The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
    public Node() {
        val = 0;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    public Node(int _val, ArrayList<Node> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
}
*/

class Solution {
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if (node == null) return null;

        HashMap<Node, Node> visited = new HashMap<>();//記錄下兩節點關係
        Node clone = new Node(node.val);
        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();

        visited.put(node, clone);
        queue.offer(node);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Node cur = queue.poll();

            List<Node> newNeighbors = visited.get(cur).neighbors;//取得clone 鄰居list
            for (Node n : cur.neighbors) {// scan 當前節點的鄰居
                if (!visited.containsKey(n)) {
                    visited.put(n, new Node(n.val));//製造新結點
                    queue.offer(n);
                }
                newNeighbors.add(visited.get(n));//新neighbor放新節點
            }
        }
        return clone;
    }
}
